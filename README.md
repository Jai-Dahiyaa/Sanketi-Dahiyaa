## 💡 About Me  
I'm a backend developer currently in my learning phase, focused on building secure and scalable systems using Node.js, Express.js, Redis, and PostgreSQL. I enjoy solving real-world backend problems and designing clean, modular architectures.

I'm actively learning CI/CD tools like Docker and Jenkins, and exploring typed backend development with TypeScript and NestJS.
